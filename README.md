# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains python scripts that solve the advent of code programming challenges.

## Solve each problem in two ways:
  1. First, only using python standard libraries
  2. Second, include other libraries if it helps

## Structure of the scripts
  Some *days* are divided into as many part as the challenge has. Each script will contain one or two implementations as noted above.
